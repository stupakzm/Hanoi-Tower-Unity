# Hanoi-Tower-Unity

**The game "Hanoi Towers"**
is a classic puzzle game featuring towers with disks of different sizes that need to be moved from one tower to another, following the rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, and the disk must always be on a disk larger than it. The main goal is to move all the disks from the first tower to the last, using the intermediate towers, in as few moves as possible.

Features of the game:
Configurable number of disks: Players can choose the number of disks from 3 to 9 to test their management skills in different difficulty levels.

Ability to change the color scheme: The game provides the ability to choose the color scheme of your choice: light, dark or alternating light and dark.

Counting the number of moves: The game keeps track of the number of moves the player uses to solve the puzzle.

Mouse control: The game is controlled with the mouse. Pressing the right mouse button selects the top disk, and releasing the button moves the disk.

Timer: The game has a built-in timer that records the time spent solving the puzzle. This allows players to test their time management skills and compete for records.
